## About Me

I am a curious individual with a passion for technology, machinery, and everything related. Although I am well aware of the challenges in this field, I will ceaselessly strive to enhance my skills and achieve new milestones.

## Life Philosophy

I believe life is short, and I enjoy doing what I love without caring about the opinions of others. Life is too brief to waste time worrying about unimportant opinions.
